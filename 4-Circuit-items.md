## Resistor

A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat, may be used as part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for generators. Fixed resistors have resistances that only change slightly with temperature, time or operating voltage. Variable resistors can be used to adjust circuit elements (such as a volume control or a lamp dimmer), or as sensing devices for heat, light, humidity, force, or chemical activity.

Resistors are common elements of electrical networks and electronic circuits and are ubiquitous in electronic equipment. Practical resistors as discrete components can be composed of various compounds and forms. Resistors are also implemented within integrated circuits.

The electrical function of a resistor is specified by its resistance: common commercial resistors are manufactured over a range of more than nine orders of magnitude. The nominal value of the resistance falls within the manufacturing tolerance, indicated on the component.

### Series and parallel resistors

The total resistance of resistors connected in series is the sum of their individual resistance values

$$
R_\mathrm{eq} = R_1  + R_2 + \cdots + R_n
$$

The total resistance of resistors connected in parallel is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistors.

$$
\frac{1}{R_\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots +  \frac{1}{R_n}
$$

For example, a 10 ohm resistor connected in parallel with a 5 ohm resistor and a 15 ohm resistor produces `1/(1/10 + 1/5 + 1/15)` ohms of resistance, or `30/11 = 2.727 ohms`.

A resistor network that is a combination of parallel and series connections can be broken up into smaller parts that are either one or the other.

### Power dissipation

At any instant, the power P (watts) consumed by a resistor of resistance R (ohms) is calculated as: ${\displaystyle P=I^{2}R=IV={\frac {V^{2}}{R}}}
P =I^2 R = I V =  \frac{V^2}{R}$
where `V` (volts) is the voltage across the resistor and I (amps) is the current flowing through it. Using _Ohm's law_, the two other forms can be derived. This power is converted into heat which must be dissipated by the resistor's package before its temperature rises excessively.

Resistors are rated according to their maximum power dissipation. Discrete resistors in solid-state electronic systems are typically rated as `1/10`, `1/8`, or `1/4` watt. They usually absorb much less than a watt of electrical power and require little attention to their power rating.

## Inductor

An _inductor_, also called a coil, choke, or reactor, is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it.

An inductor typically consists of an insulated wire wound into a coil around a core.

When the current flowing through an inductor changes, the time-varying magnetic field induces an electromotive force (_e.m.f_) (_voltage_) in the conductor, described by _Faraday's law_ of induction. According to _Lenz's law_, the induced voltage has a polarity (direction) which opposes the change in current that created it. As a result, inductors oppose any changes in current through them.

An inductor is characterized by its inductance, which is the ratio of the voltage to the rate of change of current. In the _International System of Units_ (SI), the unit of inductance is the henry (`H`) named for 19th century American scientist _Joseph Henry_.

In the measurement of magnetic circuits, it is equivalent to `weber/ampere`.

Inductors have values that typically range from `1 µH (10−6 H)` to `20 H`. Many inductors have a magnetic core made of iron or ferrite inside the coil, which serves to increase the magnetic field and thus the inductance.

Along with capacitors and resistors, inductors are one of the three passive linear circuit elements that make up electronic circuits. Inductors are widely used in alternating current (`AC`) electronic equipment, particularly in radio equipment. They are used to block `AC` while allowing `DC` to pass; inductors designed for this purpose are called chokes.

They are also used in electronic filters to separate signals of different frequencies, and in combination with capacitors to make tuned circuits, used to tune radio and TV receivers.

An electric current flowing through a conductor generates a magnetic field surrounding it. The magnetic flux linkage ${\displaystyle \Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}{\displaystyle \Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}$ generated by a given current ${\displaystyle I}$ depends on the geometric shape of the circuit. Their ratio defines the inductance ${\displaystyle L}$.

Thus

$$
{\displaystyle L:={\frac {\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}{I}}}{\displaystyle L:={\frac {\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}{I}}}.
$$

The inductance of a circuit depends on the geometry of the current path as well as the magnetic permeability of nearby materials. An inductor is a component consisting of a wire or other conductor shaped to increase the magnetic flux through the circuit, usually in the shape of a coil or helix. Winding the wire into a coil increases the number of times the magnetic flux lines link the circuit, increasing the field and thus the inductance. The more turns, the higher the inductance. The inductance also depends on the shape of the coil, separation of the turns, and many other factors. By adding a "magnetic core" made of a ferromagnetic material like iron inside the coil, the magnetizing field from the coil will induce magnetization in the material, increasing the magnetic flux. The high permeability of a ferromagnetic core can increase the inductance of a coil by a factor of several thousand over what it would be without it.

### Constitutive equation

Any change in the current through an inductor creates a changing flux, inducing a voltage across the inductor. By Faraday's law of induction, the voltage induced by any change in magnetic flux through the circuit is given by

$$
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=-{\frac {d\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}{dt}}}{\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=-{\frac {d\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}{dt}}}
$$

Reformulating the definition of

${\displaystyle L}$ above, we obtain

$$
{\displaystyle \Phi _{\mathbf {B} }=LI}{\displaystyle \Phi _{\mathbf {B} }=LI}
$$

It follows, that

$$
{\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=-{\frac {d\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}{dt}}=-{\frac {d}{dt}}(LI)=-L{\frac {dI}{dt}}}{\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=-{\frac {d\Phi _{\mathbf {B} }}{dt}}=-{\frac {d}{dt}}(LI)=-L{\frac {dI}{dt}}}
$$

for ${\displaystyle L}$ independent of time.

So inductance is also a measure of the amount of electromotive force (voltage) generated for a given rate of change of current. For example, an inductor with an inductance of 1 henry produces an EMF of 1 volt when the current through the inductor changes at the rate of `1` ampere per second. This is usually taken to be the constitutive relation (defining equation) of the inductor.

The dual of the inductor is the capacitor, which stores energy in an electric field rather than a magnetic field. Its current–voltage relation is obtained by exchanging current and voltage in the inductor equations and replacing `L` with the capacitance `C`.

Circuit equivalence at short-time limit and long-time limit.

In a circuit, an inductor can behave differently at different time instant. However, it's usually easy to think about the short-time limit and long-time limit:

In the long-time limit, after the magnetic flux through the inductor has stabilized, no voltage would be induced between the two sides of the inductor; Therefore, the long-time equivalence of an inductor is a wire (i.e. short circuit, or `0 V` battery).
In the short-time limit, if the inductor starts with a certain current I, since the current through the inductor is known at this instant, we can replace it with an ideal current source of current `I`.

Specifically, if `I=0` (no current goes through the inductor at initial instant), the short-time equivalence of an inductor is an open circuit (i.e. `0 A` current source).

## Lenz's law

The polarity (direction) of the induced voltage is given by Lenz's law, which states that the induced voltage will be such as to oppose the change in current.

For example, if the current through an inductor is increasing, the induced voltage will be positive at the current's entrance point and negative at the exit point, tending to oppose the additional current.[7][8][9] The energy from the external circuit necessary to overcome this potential "hill" is being stored in the magnetic field of the inductor. If the current is decreasing, the induced voltage will be negative at the current's entrance point and positive at the exit point, tending to maintain the current. In this case energy from the magnetic field is being returned to the circuit.

_Energy stored in an inductor_

One intuitive explanation as to why a potential difference is induced on a change of current in an inductor goes as follows:

When there is a change in current through an inductor there is a change in the strength of the magnetic field. For example, if the current is increased, the magnetic field increases. This, however, does not come without a price. The magnetic field contains potential energy, and increasing the field strength requires more energy to be stored in the field. This energy comes from the electric current through the inductor. The increase in the magnetic potential energy of the field is provided by a corresponding drop in the electric potential energy of the charges flowing through the windings. This appears as a voltage drop across the windings as long as the current increases. Once the current is no longer increased and is held constant, the energy in the magnetic field is constant and no additional energy must be supplied, so the voltage drop across the windings disappears.

Similarly, if the current through the inductor decreases, the magnetic field strength decreases, and the energy in the magnetic field decreases. This energy is returned to the circuit in the form of an increase in the electrical potential energy of the moving charges, causing a voltage rise across the windings.

_Derivation_

The work done per unit charge on the charges passing the inductor is

$$
{\displaystyle -{\mathcal {E}}}{\displaystyle -{\mathcal {E}}}
$$

The negative sign indicates that the work is done against the emf, and is not done by the emf. The current ${\displaystyle I}I$ is the charge per unit time passing through the inductor. Therefore the rate of work ${\displaystyle W}W$ done by the charges against the emf, that is the rate of change of energy of the current, is given by

$$
{\displaystyle {\frac {dW}{dt}}=-{\mathcal {E}}I}{\displaystyle {\frac {dW}{dt}}=-{\mathcal {E}}I}
$$

From the constitutive equation for the inductor,

$$
{\displaystyle -{\mathcal {E}}=L{\frac {dI}{dt}}}{\displaystyle -{\mathcal {E}}=L{\frac {dI}{dt}}}
$$

So

$$
{\displaystyle {\frac {dW}{dt}}=L{\frac {dI}{dt}}\cdot I=LI\cdot {\frac {dI}{dt}}}{\displaystyle {\frac {dW}{dt}}=L{\frac {dI}{dt}}\cdot I=LI\cdot {\frac {dI}{dt}}}
{\displaystyle dW=LI\cdot dI}{\displaystyle dW=LI\cdot dI}
$$

In a ferromagnetic core inductor, when the magnetic field approaches the level at which the core saturates, the inductance will begin to change, it will be a function of the current ${\displaystyle L(I)}{\displaystyle L(I)}$. Neglecting losses, the energy ${\displaystyle W}W$ stored by an inductor with a current ${\displaystyle I*{0}}I*{0}$ passing through it is equal to the amount of work required to establish the current through the inductor. This is given by:

$$
{\displaystyle W=\int _{0}^{I_{0}}L(I)IdI}{\displaystyle W=\int _{0}^{I_{0}}L(I)IdI}
$$

In an air core inductor or a ferromagnetic core inductor below saturation, the inductance is constant, so the stored energy is

$$
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}W&=L\int _{0}^{I_{0}}IdI\\W&={\frac {1}{2}}L{I_{0}}^{2}\end{aligned}}}{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}W&=L\int _{0}^{I_{0}}IdI\\W&={\frac {1}{2}}L{I_{0}}^{2}\end{aligned}}}
$$

For inductors with magnetic cores, the above equation is only valid for linear regions of the magnetic flux, at currents below the saturation level of the inductor, where the inductance is approximately constant. Where this is not the case, the integral form must be used with ${\displaystyle L*{I}}{\displaystyle L*{I}}$ variable.

## Capacitor

A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It is a passive electronic component with two terminals.

The effect of a capacitor is known as capacitance. While some capacitance exists between any two electrical conductors in proximity in a circuit, a capacitor is a component designed to add capacitance to a circuit. The capacitor was originally known as a condenser or condensator.[1] This name and its cognates are still widely used in many languages, but rarely in English, one notable exception being condenser microphones, also called capacitor microphones.

The physical form and construction of practical capacitors vary widely and many types of capacitor are in common use. Most capacitors contain at least two electrical conductors often in the form of metallic plates or surfaces separated by a dielectric medium. A conductor may be a foil, thin film, sintered bead of metal, or an electrolyte. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, paper, mica, air, and oxide layers.

Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy, although real-life capacitors do dissipate a small amount. (See Non-ideal behavior) When an electric potential, a voltage, is applied across the terminals of a capacitor, for example when a capacitor is connected across a battery, an electric field develops across the dielectric, causing a net positive charge to collect on one plate and net negative charge to collect on the other plate. No current actually flows through the dielectric. However, there is a flow of charge through the source circuit.

If the condition is maintained sufficiently long, the current through the source circuit ceases. If a time-varying voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor, the source experiences an ongoing current due to the charging and discharging cycles of the capacitor.

The earliest forms of capacitors were created in the 1740s, when European experimenters discovered that electric charge could be stored in water-filled glass jars that came to be known as Leyden jars. In 1748, _Benjamin Franklin_ connected a series of jars together to create what he called an "electrical battery", from their visual similarity to a battery of cannon, which became the standard English term electric battery.

Today, capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits for blocking direct current while allowing alternating current to pass. In analog filter networks, they smooth the output of power supplies. In resonant circuits they tune radios to particular frequencies. In electric power transmission systems, they stabilize voltage and power flow.

### Theory of operation

A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by a _non-conductive region_. The non-conductive region can either be a vacuum or an electrical insulator material known as a dielectric.

Examples of dielectric media are glass, air, paper, plastic, ceramic, and even a semiconductor depletion region chemically identical to the conductors.

From _Coulomb's law_ a charge on one conductor will exert a force on the charge carriers within the other conductor, attracting opposite polarity charge and repelling like polarity charges, thus an opposite polarity charge will be induced on the surface of the other conductor. The conductors thus hold equal and opposite charges on their facing surfaces, and the dielectric develops an electric field.

An ideal capacitor is characterized by a constant capacitance C, in farads in the SI system of units, defined as the ratio of the positive or negative charge Q on each conductor to the voltage V between them:

$$
{\displaystyle C={\frac {Q}{V}}}C={\frac {Q}{V}}
$$

A capacitance of one farad (F) means that one coulomb of charge on each conductor causes a voltage of one volt across the device. Because the conductors (or plates) are close together, the opposite charges on the conductors attract one another due to their electric fields, allowing the capacitor to store more charge for a given voltage than when the conductors are separated, yielding a larger capacitance.

In practical devices, charge build-up sometimes affects the capacitor mechanically, causing its capacitance to vary. In this case, capacitance is defined in terms of incremental changes:

$$
{\displaystyle C={\frac {\mathrm {d} Q}{\mathrm {d} V}}}C={\frac {\mathrm {d} Q}{\mathrm {d} V}}
$$
