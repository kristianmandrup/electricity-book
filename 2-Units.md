## Volt

The _volt_ (symbol: `V`) is the derived unit for _electric potential_, _electric potential difference_ (voltage), and _electromotive force_. It is named after the Italian physicist _Alessandro Volta_ (1745–1827).

One volt is defined as the difference in electric potential between two points of a conducting wire when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points. Equivalently, it is the potential difference between two points that will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge that passes through it. It can be expressed in terms of SI base units (`m`, `kg`, `s`, and `A`) as:

`V = potential energy / charge = J/C = kg * m^2 / A * s^3`

It can also be expressed as amperes times ohms (_current_ times _resistance_, _Ohm's law_), _webers_ per second (_magnetic flux_ per _time_), _watts_ per _ampere_ (_power_ per _unit current_, definition of electric power), or _joules_ per _coulomb_ (_energy_ per _unit charge_), which is also equivalent to _volts_ per _elementary charge_:

`V = A * Ohms = Wb/s = W/A = J/C = eV/e`

## Ampere

The _ampere_ (/ˈæmpɪər, æmˈpɪər/ or /ˈæmpɛər/ (UK), symbol: `A`), often shortened to "amp", is the base unit of _electric current_ in the _International System of Units_ (SI). It is named after _André-Marie Ampère_ (1775–1836), French mathematician and physicist, considered the father of electrodynamics.

The _International System of Units_ defines the ampere in terms of other base units by measuring the electromagnetic force between electrical conductors carrying electric current.

The ampere is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge `e` to be `1.602 × 10^19` when expressed in the unit `C` (coulomb), which is equal to `A⋅s`, where the second is defined in terms of `∆νCs`, the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the `caesium-133` atom.

The SI unit of charge, the coulomb, "is the quantity of electricity carried in `1` second by a current of `1` ampere". Conversely, a current of `1` ampere is `1` `coulomb` of charge going past a given point per second:

`1\A = 1\C/s`

In general, charge `Q` is determined by steady current `I` flowing for a time `t` as `Q = I t`.

Constant, instantaneous and average current are expressed in amperes (as in "the charging current is 1.2 A") and the charge accumulated (or passed through a circuit) over a period of time is expressed in coulombs (as in "the battery charge is 30000 C"). The relation of the ampere (`C/s`) to the coulomb is the same as that of the watt (`J/s`) to the joule.

## Watts

The _watt_ (symbol: `W`) is a unit of power. In the International System of Units (SI) it is defined as a derived unit of `1` _joule per second_, and is used to quantify the rate of _energy transfer_. In SI base units, the _watt_ is described as `kg⋅m2⋅s^-3`. The watt is named after _James Watt_, an 18th-century Scottish inventor.

## Ohm

The _ohm_ (symbol: `Ω`) is the SI derived unit of _electrical resistance_, named after German physicist _Georg Simon Ohm_. Although several empirically derived standard units for expressing electrical resistance were developed in connection with early telegraphy practice, the _British Association for the Advancement of Science_ proposed a unit derived from existing units of mass, length and time and of a convenient size for practical work as early as 1861.

The ohm is defined as an _electrical resistance between two points of a conductor_ when a constant potential difference of one volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of `1` ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.

`Ohms = V/A = 1/S = V^2/W = s/F = H/s = J*s/C^2 = kg*m^2/s*C^2 = J/s*A^2 = kg*m^2/s^3*A^2`

in which the following units appear: volt (`V`), ampere (`A`), siemens (`S`), watt (`W`), second (s), farad (`F`), henry (`H`), joule (`J`), coulomb (`C`), kilogram (`kg`), and metre (`m`).

In many cases the resistance of a conductor in ohms is approximately constant within a certain range of voltages, temperatures, and other parameters. These are called linear resistors.

In _alternating current circuits_, _electrical impedance_ is also measured in ohms.

## Coulomb

The _coulomb_ (symbol: `C`) is the International _System of Units_ (SI) unit of electric charge.

The unit is the amount of electric charge (symbol: `Q` or `q`) transported by a constant electric current of `1` ampere (`A`) in `1` second (`s`):

$$
{\displaystyle 1~{\text{C}}=1~{\text{A}}\times 1~{\text{s}}}{\displaystyle 1~{\text{C}}=1~{\text{A}}\times 1~{\text{s}}}
$$

Thus, it is also the amount of excess charge on a capacitor of one farad charged to a potential difference of one volt:

$$
{\displaystyle 1~{\text{C}}=1~{\text{F}}\times 1~{\text{V}}}{\displaystyle 1~{\text{C}}=1~{\text{F}}\times 1~{\text{V}}}
$$

Under the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units, which took effect on 20 May 2019, the elementary charge (the charge of the proton and of the electron, but also of other fundamental particles) is exactly `1.602176634×10−19` coulombs.

Thus the coulomb is the charge of exactly `1/(1.602176634×10−19`) elementary charges, which is approximately `6.2415090744×1018` elementary charges (`1.036×10−5 mol`). The same number of electrons has the same magnitude but opposite sign of charge, that is, a charge of `−1 C`.
