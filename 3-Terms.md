## Electrical impedance

In electrical engineering, _electrical impedance_ is the measure of the _opposition_ that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied.

Quantitatively, the impedance of a two-terminal circuit element is the _ratio_ of the complex representation of the _sinusoidal voltage between its terminals_, to the complex representation of the _current_ flowing through it. In general, it depends upon the _frequency of the sinusoidal voltage_.

Impedance extends the concept of _resistance_ to _alternating current (`AC`) circuits_, and possesses both _magnitude_ and _phase_, unlike resistance, which has only magnitude. When a circuit is driven with _direct current_ (`DC`), there is _no distinction between impedance and resistance_; the latter can be thought of as _impedance with zero phase angle_.

Impedance is a _complex number_, with the _same units as resistance_, for which the SI unit is the _ohm_ (`Ω`). Its symbol is usually `Z`, and it may be represented by writing its magnitude and phase in the polar form |Z|∠θ. However, cartesian complex number representation is often more powerful for circuit analysis purposes.

The notion of impedance is useful for performing AC analysis of electrical networks, because it allows relating sinusoidal voltages and currents by a simple linear law. In multiple port networks, the two-terminal definition of impedance is inadequate, but the complex voltages at the ports and the currents flowing through them are still linearly related by the impedance matrix.

The reciprocal of _impedance_ is _admittance_, whose SI unit is the _siemens_, formerly called _mho_.

Instruments used to measure the electrical impedance are called _impedance analyzers_.

The term impedance was coined by _Oliver Heaviside_ in July 1886. _Arthur Kennelly_ was the first to represent impedance with complex numbers in 1893.

In addition to resistance as seen in `DC` circuits, impedance in `AC` circuits includes the effects of the induction of voltages in conductors by the _magnetic fields_ (_inductance_), and the electrostatic storage of charge induced by voltages between _conductors_ (_capacitance_).

The impedance caused by these two effects is collectively referred to as _reactance_ and forms the _imaginary part of complex impedance_ whereas _resistance_ forms the _real part_.

Impedance is defined as the frequency domain ratio of the voltage to the current. In other words, it is the voltage–current ratio for a single complex exponential at a particular frequency `ω`.

For a sinusoidal current or voltage input, the polar form of the complex impedance relates the amplitude and phase of the voltage and current. In particular:

The magnitude of the complex impedance is the ratio of the voltage amplitude to the current amplitude;

The phase of the complex impedance is the phase shift by which the current lags the voltage.

The impedance of a two-terminal circuit element is represented as a complex quantity `Z`

The _polar form_ conveniently captures both magnitude and phase characteristics as

`Z=|Z|e^j*arg(Z)`

where the magnitude `|Z|` represents the ratio of the voltage difference amplitude to the current amplitude, while the argument `arg(Z)` (commonly given the symbol `theta` gives the phase difference between voltage and current. `j` is the _imaginary unit_, and is used instead of `i` in this context to avoid confusion with the symbol for electric current.

In Cartesian form, impedance is defined as

`Z=R+jX`

Where the _real part_ of impedance is the resistance `R` and the _imaginary part_ is the reactance `X`.
